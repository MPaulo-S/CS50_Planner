README

To use the planner application, a few libraries are required. In the current setup, some libraries are downloaded and saved within the project to facilitate the implementation of my first project. 
For these libraries the compatibility is usually given, but changing them to reference online libraries might require some rework before it is functioning as expected.

For now reference the libraries as they are given in the project. I have not created the README file yet, as I plan. to learn about react and django implementation next. 
With this I aim to refactor the current project accordingly and in this context the README file will also be updated.
